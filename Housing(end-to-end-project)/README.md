## 📚 Based on *Hands-On Machine Learning* - Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project is a **work-in-progress** and part of my learning journey through the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron.  
It follows the **End-to-End Machine Learning Project** from Chapter 2, using the California Housing dataset to walk through a complete ML pipeline.
